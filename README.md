# workflow-apps-script
Template for a workflow to track tasks that follow steps.
It can alert on due and expired steps per each task, while also navigating to alerted cells with a single click.
It also demonstrates the use of conditional rules and ARRAYFORMULA.

Example: [this spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1kRnbSzclNyaXg2glYmJ6GJWVK3a2_EF7LEpD_p5tr9Q/edit#gid=1467227136) implements a workflow to track states (columns) of a list of people (rows) by coloring cells that need attention.

To use the spreadsheet, make a copy of the spreadsheet first, then refresh the spreadsheet and use the newly installed "System" menu.
